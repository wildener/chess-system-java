# Chess System Application
The Chess System application was developed by Professor Nelio Alves (@acenelio) for the Java + OO programming course 
(https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo).
My goal in carrying out this course was to review the basic principles of Java and object-oriented programming, 
as well as more advanced subjects such as object-relational mapping, applications based on Spring Boot, 
and communication via web service through the REST protocol.

The Chess System allows the user to play chess through the console (preferably Git Bash). It implements the rules of the game, including special moves: 
castling, en passant and promotion. The study and implementation of the source code allows the exercise of basic to intermediate concepts.
Just below an image of the initial status of the game.
